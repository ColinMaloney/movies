# Getting data from gross profits and movie ratings to find out if the ratings of the movies have any statistical affect on the movie's grossing profits. 

Imdb Scores: 
"All the registered members of IMDb can cast their votes/ratings for any movie. IMDb takes all the individual votes cast by the registered users and uses them to calculate a single rating.The formula for calculating the Top Rated 250 Titles gives a true Bayesian estimate:
 weighted rating (WR) = (v ÷ (v+m)) × R + (m ÷ (v+m)) × C where:
R = average for the movie (mean) = (Rating)
v = number of votes for the movie = (votes)
m = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 250 (currently 25000)
C = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 7.0)
for the Top 250, only votes from regular voters are considered."

Rotten Tomatoes Scores: 
"The opinions of about 3,000 critics — a.k.a. the “Approved Tomatometer Critics” who have met a series of criteria set by Rotten Tomatoes — are included in the site’s scores, though not every critic reviews every film, so any given score is more typically derived from a few hundred critics, or even less. The scores don’t include just anyone who calls themselves a critic or has a movie blog; Rotten Tomatoes only aggregates critics who have been regularly publishing movie reviews with a reasonably widely read outlet for at least two years, and those critics must be “active,” meaning they've published at least one review in the last year. The site also deems a subset of critics to be “top critics” and calculates a separate score that only includes them."

Metacritics Scores: 
"The user votes are not included in the METASCORE. The METASCORE is a weighted average of the published critic reviews contained in the chart on that page, and thus does not include any votes or comments from our users. However, you may, of course, see the average user vote by glancing at the USER SCORE to the right of the METASCORE on every summary page."
